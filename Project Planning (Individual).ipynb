    "**The broad question I decided to focus on was:**\n",
    "- Question 2: We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The specific question I want to explore:**\n",
    "- Can a player’s age and total played hours predict their experience level in Minecraft?\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the data will address this question:**\n",
    "- The players dataset contains information on each player’s age, total played hours, and experience level.\n",
    "- These variables will allow me to build a classification model that predicts a player’s experience category based on how long they play and their age.\n",
    "- This will help determine what types of players (for example, those who play longer or are older) have greater experience levels. This then means they would be more likely to contribute a large amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before analysis, I will wrangle the dataset by:**\n",
    "- Ensuring all numeric values (like total played hours) are clean and consistent\n",
    "- Checking for and handling any missing values.\n",
    "- Combining similar experience categories to simplify the classification. -> \"Amateur\" and \"Beginner\" (Novice), \"Regular\" (Intermediate), \"Veteran\" and \"Pro\"(Advanced)\n",
    "- I will then apply KNN classification model to predict experience level from player's age and total time played\n",
    "- This analysis will provide insights into which player characteristics are linked to higher experience, thus more data contribution and therefore help the researchers recruit those type of players."
